# Global config settings

## Config file content
The config.js file should export an object. The settings are only loaded once at the startup of the app.
Only values that can be calculated at the time of the import should be used.
Values that can only be calculated async are discouraged.

Example:
```js
import { join as pathJoin } from 'path';

export default {
    setting1: 'value1',
    setting2: 'value2',
    setting3: pathJoin('value3', 'value4'),
};
```

## Config file structure

### appModules

This group of settings contain information about the app modules.

`appPaths`: The location of modules in the app. Inside each of the path are vendor folders located.
            Each vendor folder may contain multiple modules.
`appPackages`: Contains references to modules that can be imported in case the app module is defined in an external package (for example nodejs modules).
`excludedModules`: A list of modules that should not be loaded. The structure is `VendorName/ModuleName`.

## web server settings

`hostname`: The hostname the web server should listen on.
`port`: The port the web server should listen on.
