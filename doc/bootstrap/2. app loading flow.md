# App loading flow

## Bootstrap file

As explained in the [app folder structure](1.%20app%20folder%20structure.md), the `index.js` bootstrap file is the entry point of the app.

## boot flow

### Collect main config settings
All files in the `config/` directory are loaded in alphabetical order.

See [Global config settings](3.%20Global%20config%20settings.md) about the config file structure.

### Load modules
After the config settings are collected, all module locations should be known by now.
From now on, all modules can be collected and loaded.

### Load instances
After all modules are loaded, all module specific settings are known.
By then, all app scoped instances can be loaded.
Each instance (for example the web server) can directly load settings from the modules.
